§1.0  Tor Bridge Distribution

Tor Bridge Distribution includes the maintenance of critical infrastructural
systems such as BridgeDB, while also working to improve the robustness,
scalability, and maintainability of those systems. It also includes the
development of more secure and user-friendly mechanisms for bridge
distribution. Without this essential work, much of the Tor Projects' efforts
in the area of censorship circumvention would be unusable.

For additional background information, please see the additional Reference
materials, Exhibit A.

§1.1  Background

BridgeDB has been a free and publicly available service since 2006. Since its
inception, BridgeDB has consistently held a number of bridges between half and
two-thirds the number of total relays in the Tor network, with its databases
currently holding over 4,000 bridges relays [0] and over 12,000
Pluggable-Transport—enabled bridges for distribution to users in censored
regions. There are approximately 12,000 to 15,000 Tor bridge users per day,
using bridges which BridgeDB has distributed. (Please see additional Reference
materials [1] and [2].)

BridgeDB's website (see additional Reference material [3]) sees 4.5 million
initial page hits per day, and hands out Tor bridges over HTTPS to users
roughly 75,000 times per day. BridgeDB's email autoresponder receives 525,000
emails per day, replies to users with help and configuration assistance
350,000 times per day, and emails Tor bridges to users roughly 50,000 times
per day. All of BridgeDB's user interfaces are translated and localised into
45 different languages and dialects.

§1.2  Terminology

Throughout this and the following sections, the grant applicant for the Open
Technology Fund's (OTF) Emerging Technologies Fellowship Program (ETFP) shall
be referred to as "The ETFP Fellow" or, simply, "The Fellow". The recipient of
the goods and/or services provided by The ETFP Fellow will simply be referred
to as "OTF".

§2.0  Scope of Work

The Fellowship's Scope of Work shall consists of a full-time effort to:

    * Maintain BridgeDB and other Tor Bridge Distribution infrastructure,

    * Mitigate any reported or discovered vulnerabilities within the components of said
      infrastructure,

    * Develop improved solutions for distributing Tor Bridges to end-user
      clients, and

    * Improve the reliability, scalability, and future maintainability of the
      underlying systems and their codebases.

§2.1  Objectives

The Fellow shall strive to ensure that all code and operational procedures are
developed with the end-user's security, privacy, and usability prioritised
above all other improvements.

Additionally, The Fellow shall, at all times, strive to make BridgeDB and
other codebases concerning Tor Bridge Distribution as maintainable,
comprehendable, and easily extensible as possible.

§3.0  Statement of Work (SOW)

§3.1  Tasks and Deliverables

With respect to the maintenance and improvement of Tor Bridge Distribution,
The ETFP Fellow shall undertake the following Tasks within the duration of the
Fellowship:

 SOW.1. The Fellow shall migrate BridgeDB's cluster of servers to a new host
        machine. This new host has already been graciously donated to The Tor
        Project, however, the migration process will require some time and may
        require some possible development work to complete. This server
        migration will result in increased server resources, improved uptime,
        and will enable development of the more resource intensive processes
        necessary for the future scalability improvements.

 SOW.2. The Fellow shall refactor legacy sections of BridgeDB's codebase to
        utilise a new Tor parser library. This library is commonly-maintained
        by several developers and volunteers at The Tor Project, thus, this
        initial refactoring will result in a great reduction in future efforts
        spent maintaining the BridgeDB's codebase, as well as additional speed
        improvements and increased uptime for the production servers which
        distribute Tor bridges to clients. (see additional Reference materials
        [4] [5] [6] [7])

 SOW.3. The Fellow shall implement scalability improvements to Tor Bridge
        Distribution backend infrastructure, including but not limited to:

        SOW.3.1. Migration of BridgeDB's databases to a distributed,
                  asynchronous database system and add support for using a
                  caching key-value store (see additional Reference materials,
                  Exhibit X, for further details regarding proposed
                  implementation, and see also [8] [9] [10]), and,

        SOW.3.2. Improvements to sections of the core Tor codebase which
                 determine the behaviours of the Directory Authorities and
                 Bridge Authority, when necessary.

 SOW.4. The Fellow shall provide continued maintenance of infrastructure
        related to Tor Bridge Distribution, including but not limited to:

        SOW.4.1. Systems administration maintenance and supervision regarding
                 production systems used by The Tor Project, Inc., for Tor
                 Bridge Distribution to end-user clients.

        SOW.4.2. Timely response and mitigation to any reported or discovered
                 vulnerabilities within production systems used by The Tor
                 Project, Inc., for Tor Bridge Distribution to end-user
                 clients, including code review and vulnerability mitigation
                 for underlying software infrastructure required for
                 maintaining said systems.

 SOW.5. The Fellow shall continue to publicly interface with the general Tor
        volunteer community to review submitted patches, and shall provide
        assistance and mentorship to new volunteers interested in contributing
        to any portions of codebases belonging to The Tor Project, Inc., which
        concern Tor Bridge Distribution and closely-related systems such as
        Pluggable Transport development.

 SOW.6. The Fellow shall create an Application Programming Interface (API) to
        enable easier and more rapid future developments of additional Tor
        Bridge Distribution mechanisms (commonly referred to as "Bridge
        Distributors").

        This API shall allow Bridge Distributors to be run on production
        servers separate from the database systems, increasing the security,
        integrity, and auditability of both the Bridge Distributors and the
        backend databases. This API shall also provide for easy development of
        novel Bridge Distributors, for example, such as a Twitter bot which
        distributes Tor Bridges, or a Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) Firefox
        extension which automatically retrieves new Tor Bridges for clients
        after detecting that some threshold of the client's current set of Tor
        Bridges are not reachable or not functioning correctly. (See
        additional Reference materials [10] [11], and SOW.9.1)

 SOW.7. The Fellow shall produce additional documentation, both developer- and
        user-facing, for Tor Bridges, BridgeDB, and various Pluggable
        Transports, and shall improve the clarity and update existing
        documentation when necessary.

 SOW.8. The Fellow shall develop improved User Interfaces (UIs) for
        interacting with clients to distribute Tor Bridges. (See additional
        Reference materials [12], although additional tasks are likely to
        arise.)

 SOW.9. The Fellow shall research potential future improvements concerning Tor
        Bridge Distribution, and shall publicly report on these research
        efforts and their proposed implementations.

        SOW.9.1 The Fellow shall research the feasibility and implementation
                difficultly of creating a new TBB Firefox extension to
                automatedly distribute bridges to clients who have few
                remaining reachable or functional bridges remaining in their
                Tor configuration file.
        
                SOW.9.1.2 The Fellow shall research, design, and document a
                          proposed implementation of an Inter-Process
                          Communication (IPC) channel between TBB and
                          BridgeDB. (See additional Reference materials,
                          Exhibit Y, for a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
                          diagram of the systems components involved.)

 SOW.10. The Fellow shall research the implementation difficulty costs
         associated with implementing a modified version of the "Social
         Distributor" defined in the rBridge paper. (See additional Reference
         materials, Exhibit Z, for the rBridge paper, and additional Reference
         materials [13] for a ticket discussion previous, not-yet-complete,
         research.)

         This research will stand as the basis for later implementation of an
         automated, privacy-preserving, Tor Bridge Distributor that uses
         measurements of a user's "good behaviour" (i.e. the user's bridges
         have not been blocked by a censoring party), as well as invite
         tokens, to create a highly censorship-resistant Tor Bridge
         distribution mechanism, wherein censoring parties and their sybils
         are "locked out" of the system and unable to obtain bridges. The
         results of this research shall be publicly documented as an
         implementation proposal.

         SOW.10.1. The Fellow shall investigate the current implementation
                   feasibility, and server-side efficiency, of the underlying
                   cryptographic primitives required by the design of the
                   "Social Distributor" contained within the rBridge paper,
                   including, but not limited to, anonymous credentials and
                   oblivious transfer. (See additional Reference materials
                   [14])

                   SOW.10.1.1. The Fellow shall investigate the reusability of
                               any previously-published implementations of
                               these requisite cryptographic primitives.

                   SOW.10.1.2. The Fellow shall consult with cryptologic
                               experts concerning the safest implementation
                               strategy for these primitives, should no
                               acceptable implementations already exist.

                   SOW.10.1.3. The Fellow shall consult with cryptologic
                               experts concerning any modifications made to
                               the original design of the "Social Distributor"
                               defined in the rBridge paper in order to
                               evaluate their ramifications for security,
                               privacy, and anonymity.

         SOW.10.2. The Fellow shall investigate the feasibility of
                   implementing the client-side portion of the codebase for
                   the "Social Distributor" on top of the TBB Firefox
                   extension defined in SOW.9.1.

                   SOW.10.2.1. The Fellow shall consult with the TBB
                               development team to arrive at a design that is
                               satisfactory to the TBB development team.
