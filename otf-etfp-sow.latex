\section{Tor Bridge Distribution}
\label{intro}

\paragraph{}Tor Bridge Distribution includes the maintenance of critical infrastructural
systems such as BridgeDB, while also working to improve the robustness,
scalability, and maintainability of those systems. It also includes the
development of more secure and user-friendly mechanisms for bridge
distribution. Without this essential work, much of the Tor Projects' efforts
in the area of censorship circumvention would be unusable.

\subsection{Background}
\label{background}

\paragraph{} For additional background information, please see the additional Reference
materials, Exhibit A. \cite{ExhibitA}

\paragraph{}BridgeDB has been a free and publicly available service since 2006. Since its
inception, BridgeDB has consistently held a number of bridges between half and
two-thirds the number of total relays in the Tor network, with its databases
currently holding over 4,000 bridges relays \cite{Ref1} and over 12,000
Pluggable-Transport bridges for distribution to users in censored
regions. There are approximately 12,000 to 15,000 Tor bridge users per day,
using bridges which BridgeDB has distributed. (Please see additional Reference
materials \cite{Ref2} and \cite{Ref3}.)

\paragraph{}BridgeDB's website (see additional Reference material \cite{Ref4}) sees 4.5 million
initial page hits per day, and hands out Tor bridges over HTTPS to users
roughly 75,000 times per day. BridgeDB's email autoresponder receives 525,000
emails per day, replies to users with help and configuration assistance
350,000 times per day, and emails Tor bridges to users roughly 50,000 times
per day. All of BridgeDB's user interfaces are translated and localised into
45 different languages and dialects.

\subsection{Background Information for Primary Developer}
\label{cv}

\paragraph{}The technical lead for this project will be Isis Lovecruft. Isis has been
a developer for The Tor Project for the past five years. The first two years were spent
working on the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), a platform
for a global censorship detection system, as well as tools for the OONI platform which
detect various types of network anomalies and censorship events.

After developing OONI, Isis spent the next three years as the Lead Developer and Maintainer
of BridgeDB, however, due to lack of funding, much of this time was volunteered. At the
same time, Isis also worked for the LEAP Encryption Access Project (LEAP), developing
a transparently encrypting remailer in an effort to provide better communications security.
Isis has volunteered for, and contributed to, several other projects, including Open
Whispersystems, Briar Project, Tahoe-LAFS, and others.

\subsection{Terminology}
\label{terminology}

\paragraph{}Throughout this and the following sections, the grant applicant for the Open
Technology Fund's (OTF) Emerging Technologies Fellowship Program (ETFP) shall
be referred to as "The ETFP Fellow" or, simply, "The Fellow". The recipient of
the goods and/or services provided by The ETFP Fellow will simply be referred
to as "OTF".

\section{Scope of Work}
\label{scope}

\paragraph{}The Fellowship's Scope of Work shall consists of a full-time effort to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Maintain BridgeDB and other Tor Bridge Distribution infrastructure,
\item Mitigate any reported or discovered vulnerabilities within the components of said infrastructure,
\item Develop improved solutions for distributing Tor Bridges to end-user clients, and
\item Improve the reliability, scalability, and future maintainability of the underlying systems and their codebases.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives}
\label{objectives}

\paragraph{}The Fellow shall strive to ensure that all code and operational procedures are
developed with the end-user's security, privacy, and usability prioritised
above all other improvements.

\paragraph{}Additionally, The Fellow shall, at all times, strive to make BridgeDB and
other codebases concerning Tor Bridge Distribution as maintainable,
comprehensible, and easily extensible as possible.

\section{Statement of Work (SOW)}
\label{sow}

\subsection{Tasks and Deliverables}
\label{tasks}

\paragraph{}With respect to the maintenance and improvement of Tor Bridge Distribution,
The ETFP Fellow shall undertake the following Tasks within the duration of the
Fellowship:

\leftskip=0pt
\paragraph{SOW.1.}
        The Fellow shall migrate BridgeDB's cluster of servers to a new host
        machine. This new host has already been graciously donated to The Tor
        Project, however, the migration process will require some time and may
        require some possible development work to complete. This server
        migration will result in increased server resources, improved uptime,
        and will enable development of the more resource intensive processes
        necessary for the future scalability improvements.
        
\paragraph{SOW.2.}
        The Fellow shall refactor legacy sections of BridgeDB's codebase to
        utilise a new Tor parser library. This library is commonly-maintained
        by several developers and volunteers at The Tor Project, thus, this
        initial refactoring will result in a great reduction in future efforts
        spent maintaining the BridgeDB's codebase, as well as additional speed
        improvements and increased uptime for the production servers which
        distribute Tor bridges to clients. (See additional Reference materials
        \cite{Ref5} \cite{Ref6} \cite{Ref7} \cite{Ref8}.)

\paragraph{SOW.3.}
        The Fellow shall implement scalability improvements to Tor Bridge
        Distribution backend infrastructure, including but not limited to:

        \leftskip=20pt
        \paragraph{SOW.3.1.} 
                  Migration of BridgeDB's databases to a distributed,
                  asynchronous database system and add support for using a
                  caching key-value store (see additional Reference materials,
                  Exhibit X, for further details regarding proposed
                  implementation, and see also \cite{Ref9} \cite{Ref10}
                  \cite{Ref11}), and,

        \paragraph{SOW.3.2.} 
                 Improvements to sections of the core Tor codebase which
                 determine the behaviours of the Directory Authorities and
                 Bridge Authority, when necessary.

\leftskip=0pt
\paragraph{SOW.4.}
        The Fellow shall provide continued maintenance of infrastructure
        related to Tor Bridge Distribution, including but not limited to:

		\leftskip=20pt
        \paragraph{SOW.4.1.}
                 Systems administration maintenance and supervision regarding
                 production systems used by The Tor Project, Inc., for Tor
                 Bridge Distribution to end-user clients.
                 
        \paragraph{SOW.4.2.}
                 Timely response and mitigation to any reported or discovered
                 vulnerabilities within production systems used by The Tor
                 Project, Inc., for Tor Bridge Distribution to end-user
                 clients, including code review and vulnerability mitigation
                 for underlying software infrastructure required for
                 maintaining said systems.
                 
\leftskip=0pt
\paragraph{SOW.5.}
        The Fellow shall continue to publicly interface with the general Tor
        volunteer community to review submitted patches, and shall provide
        assistance and mentorship to new volunteers interested in contributing
        to any portions of codebases belonging to The Tor Project, Inc., which
        concern Tor Bridge Distribution and closely-related systems such as
        Pluggable Transport development.
        
\paragraph{SOW.6.}
        The Fellow shall create an Application Programming Interface (API) to
        enable easier and more rapid future developments of additional Tor
        Bridge Distribution mechanisms (commonly referred to as "Bridge
        Distributors").
\paragraph{} This API shall allow Bridge Distributors to be run on production
        servers separate from the database systems, increasing the security,
        integrity, and auditability of both the Bridge Distributors and the
        backend databases. This API shall also provide for easy development of
        novel Bridge Distributors, for example, such as a Twitter bot which
        distributes Tor Bridges, or a Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) Firefox
        extension which automatically retrieves new Tor Bridges for clients
        after detecting that some threshold of the client's current set of Tor
        Bridges are not reachable or not functioning correctly. (See
        additional Reference materials \cite{Ref11} \cite{Ref12}, and SOW.9.1.)
        
\paragraph{SOW.7.}
        The Fellow shall produce additional documentation, both developer- and
        user-facing, for Tor Bridges, BridgeDB, and various Pluggable
        Transports, and shall improve the clarity and update existing
        documentation when necessary.
        
\paragraph{SOW.8.}
        The Fellow shall develop improved User Interfaces (UIs) for
        interacting with clients to distribute Tor Bridges. (See additional
        Reference materials \cite{Ref13}, although additional tasks are likely to
        arise.)
        
\leftskip=0pt
\paragraph{SOW.9.}
        The Fellow shall research potential future improvements concerning Tor
        Bridge Distribution, and shall publicly report on these research
        efforts and their proposed implementations.
        
        \leftskip=20pt
        \paragraph{SOW.9.1}
                The Fellow shall research the feasibility and implementation
                difficultly of creating a new TBB Firefox extension to
                automatically distribute bridges to clients who have few
                remaining reachable or functional bridges remaining in their
                Tor configuration file.
        
                \leftskip=40pt
                \paragraph{SOW.9.1.2}
                          The Fellow shall research, design, and document a
                          proposed implementation of an Inter-Process
                          Communication (IPC) channel between TBB and
                          BridgeDB. (See additional Reference materials,
                          Exhibit Y, \cite{ExhibitY} for a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
                          diagram of the systems components involved.)
                          
\leftskip=0pt
\paragraph{SOW.10.}
         The Fellow shall research the implementation difficulty and costs
         associated with implementing a modified version of the "Social
         Distributor" defined in the rBridge paper. (See additional Reference
         materials, Exhibit Z, \cite{ExhibitZ} for the rBridge paper, and additional Reference
         materials \cite{Ref14} for a ticket discussing previous, not-yet-complete,
         research.)
         
\paragraph{} 
         This research will stand as the basis for later implementation of an
         automated, privacy-preserving, Tor Bridge Distributor that uses
         measurements of a user's "good behaviour" (i.e. the user's bridges
         have not been blocked by a censoring party), as well as invite
         tokens, to create a highly censorship-resistant Tor Bridge
         distribution mechanism, wherein censoring parties and their sibyls
         are "locked out" of the system and unable to obtain bridges. The
         results of this research shall be publicly documented as an
         implementation proposal.
         
         \leftskip=20pt
         \paragraph{SOW.10.1.}
                   The Fellow shall investigate the current implementation
                   feasibility, and server-side efficiency, of the underlying
                   cryptographic primitives required by the design of the
                   "Social Distributor" contained within the rBridge paper,
                   including, but not limited to, anonymous credentials and
                   oblivious transfer. (See additional Reference materials
                   \cite{Ref15})
                   
                   \leftskip=40pt
                   \paragraph{SOW.10.1.1.}
                               The Fellow shall investigate the reusability of
                               any previously-published implementations of
                               these requisite cryptographic primitives.
                               
                   \paragraph{SOW.10.1.2.}
                               The Fellow shall consult with cryptologic
                               experts concerning the safest implementation
                               strategy for these primitives, should no
                               acceptable implementations already exist.
                               
                   \paragraph{SOW.10.1.3.}
                               The Fellow shall consult with cryptologic
                               experts concerning any modifications made to
                               the original design of the "Social Distributor"
                               defined in the rBridge paper in order to
                               evaluate their ramifications for security,
                               privacy, and anonymity.
                               
         \leftskip=20pt
         \paragraph{SOW.10.2.}
                   The Fellow shall investigate the feasibility of
                   implementing the client-side portion of the codebase for
                   the "Social Distributor" on top of the TBB Firefox
                   extension defined in SOW.9.1.
                   
                   \leftskip=40pt
                   \paragraph{SOW.10.2.1.}
                               The Fellow shall consult with the TBB
                               development team to arrive at a design that is
                               satisfactory to the TBB development team.
\leftskip=0pt

\subsubsection{Acceptance Criteria}
\label{acceptance}

\paragraph{}Due to The Fellow being the Team Lead for the Tor Bridge
component of the software and hardware Tor ecosystem, as well as the Lead
Developer and Lead Maintainer of BridgeDB, the satisfactory acceptance of the
efforts and work concerning the above Deliverables, and the determination of
their completion status, shall, to some extent, be under the review and
recommendation of The Fellow. However, The Fellow shall routinely consult with
other Team Leads within The Tor Project, Inc., as well as with any Technical
Reviewers, etc., at OTF, to assess that the Deliverable are satisfied in a
manner which meets the approval of all parties.

\paragraph{}Whenever The Fellow or any other core member of the Tor Project
should decide that some submitted code is in need of code review, final
acceptance shall pend satisfactory results from a code review conducted by
another core member of the Tor Project.  That is, if code review is requested,
the Fellow is \emph{not} permitted to review code they wrote themself.  In
some cases, code review may be either irrelevant or insignificant, for
example if the proposed changes are minor or simple, and in these cases
"code review" shall consist of a public discussion resulting in an
agreement on the proposed changes.  Any and all code reviews and code
discussions shall take place via public communications channels, such that any
member of the community may observe and contribute input.

\subsubsection{Payment}
\label{payment}
\paragraph{}Provided that the Tasks and Deliverables defined in this SOW meet the
Acceptance Criteria defined in §\ref{acceptance}, and The Fellow continually meets the
provisions for Monitoring defined in §\ref{monitoring}, OTF will provide The Fellow with a
monthly stipend of \$4,200 USD, for a period up to twelve (12) months, for a
total sum of no more than \$50,400 USD.

\subsection{Schedule}
\label{schedule}
\paragraph{}The ETFP Fellowship is defined to endure for a duration of one (1) year. The
end of The ETFP Fellowship is to be interpreted relative to the start of the
ETFP Fellowship, where the start of The ETFP Fellowship is defined as the date
when both parties (i.e. OTF and The Fellow) have established a Contract and
agreed to any required Terms and Conditions.
\paragraph{} The Tasks defined in this SOW have been given in an estimated chronological
order, such that Tasks assigned a lower SOW number are to be completed prior
to tasks which have been assigned a higher number. Tasks comprised mostly of
research, namely SOW.8-10, may be completed by The Fellow at any time
throughout the duration of The ETFP Fellowship.

\subsection{Assumptions}
\label{assumptions}
\paragraph{}All work included within this SOW shall be executed by The ETFP Fellow, or by
volunteer developers who are external to The Tor Project and whose
contributions are subject to the review, approval, and supervision of The
Fellow. The Fellow shall not subcontract any of the Deliverables detailed
herein to any other party without the explicit written permission of OTF.

\subsubsection{Location of Work}
\label{location}
\paragraph{} The Fellow is unrestricted concerning the location of work, provided that The
Fellow is reasonably capable of efficiently and productively communicating
with OTF and other colleagues, including colleagues at The Tor Project, Inc.,
and other institutions and organisations with experts concerned with the
surrounding subject matter.

\subsubsection{Time Requirements}
\label{time}
\paragraph{}The Fellow shall make a time commit equivalent to that of provincial and
lawful full-time employment in the region(s) which The Fellow inhabits or
completes the Tasks as defined in the SOW within.

\subsection{Monitoring}
\label{monitoring}
\paragraph{}The Fellow shall create monthly status reports, which shall be sent to both
OTF's and The Tor Project's mailing lists. The Fellow shall, when necessary
for either collaboration or reporting, schedule, organise, and conduct online
meetings, in open public channels, with colleagues to ensure that progress is
made in a satisfactory and timely manner. The Fellow will request regular code
reviews and shall carefully consider the recommendations of the reviewers (as
outlined in the Acceptance Criteria in §\ref{acceptance}).
